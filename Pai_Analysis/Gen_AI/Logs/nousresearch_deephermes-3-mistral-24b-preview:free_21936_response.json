The geometry appears valid with closed rings and no crossing edges. Ring orientation looks correct with outer ring counterclockwise and no nested inner rings present. However, the coordinates exhibit extreme precision with 4 decimal places, which is unnecessary for most applications. The extreme decimal precision could lead to performance issues and inaccuracies in rendering and spatial operations. Simplifying the coordinates to an appropriate level of precision would be recommended.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3482,"completion_tokens":129,"total_tokens":3611,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
