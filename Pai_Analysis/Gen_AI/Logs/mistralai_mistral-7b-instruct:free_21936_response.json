After carefully examining the coordinates of the boundaries, no self-intersections, invalid geometries, ring orientation issues, or precision/coordinate problems were detected. All polygon boundaries follow a continuous path without crossing over themselves, all rings are oriented either counterclockwise for the outer ring or clockwise for the inner rings (if any), and the coordinates do not have any extreme values or show excessive precision issues.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3509,"completion_tokens":157,"total_tokens":3666}}
