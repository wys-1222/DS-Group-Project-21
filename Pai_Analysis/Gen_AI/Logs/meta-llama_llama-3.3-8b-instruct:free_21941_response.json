The coordinates of the polygon boundaries cross over each other, creating invalid geometry. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the second and third rings have overlapping boundaries, resulting in a self-intersection. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure the feature represents a valid geographic area.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1119,"completion_tokens":111,"total_tokens":1230}}
