There is no self-intersection detected as the boundary segments do not cross over themselves. All the rings have proper orientation, i.e., the outer ring is counterclockwise and the inner rings are clockwise.\n\nThe coordinates do not seem to have extreme values or excessive precision, indicating no precision/coordinate issues.\n\nThere are some relatively close points in the coordinates which might suggest a tolerance issue if high-precision computations are being performed, but they do not directly cause any errors in this case.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1862,"completion_tokens":178,"total_tokens":2040}}
