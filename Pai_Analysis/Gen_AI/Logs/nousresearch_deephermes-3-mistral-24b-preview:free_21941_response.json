The ring orientations are correct, with outer rings counterclockwise and no inner rings present. However, there are some issues with extreme coordinate precision. Many coordinates are repeated to an excessive level of decimal precision, which causes minor discrepancies that can lead to topological problems down the line. While not issue-inducing by themselves, this excessive precision can cause layer misalignment when data is reprojected or simplified.\n\nTo resolve the precision issues, the coordinates can be rounded to a reasonable level (e.g. 5-6 decimal places).
