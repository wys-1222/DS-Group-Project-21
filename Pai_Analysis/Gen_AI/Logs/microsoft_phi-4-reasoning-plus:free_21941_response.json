We'll parse provided GeoJSON.\n\nThe feature type is a MultiPolygon geometry. Let's analyze each polygon coordinate polygon array. Let's denote each polygon separately:\n\nThe coordinates array has structure: MultiPolygon. MultiPolygon is an array of polygons. Each polygon in representation is: polygon array is array-of-linear rings, where first ring is the outer ring and subsequent are holes if necessary. So here coordinates looks like:\n\n[\n  [ [list-of-coordinates], [list-of-coordinates], ... ],\n  [ ... ],\n  [ ... ]\n]\n\nI need to check the provided coordinates arrays:\n\nWe have 3 rings: The first element, i.e. first array, is a MiniPolygon? Let's see:\n\nCoordinates is: [[[[146.75748456, -19.32504827], [146.75762926, -19.32490217], [146.75763266, -19.32489997], [146.75792116, -19.32505817], [146.75792206, -19.32506267], [146.75770916, -19.32517567], [146.75789926, -19.32527617], [146.75789526, -19.32527727], [146.75792586, -19.32506537], [146.75769066, -19.32516777], [146.75768656, -19.32517007], [146.75763436, -19.32514217], [146.75763306, -19.32513787], [146.75752546, -19.32507767], [146.75752536, -19.32507367], [146.75752256, -19.32507087], [146.75748456, -19.32504827]]]\n  \nActually, when I inspect: In the coordinates array, this is the first polygon: It has outer ring only? Not sure: There's one ring inside (or sometimes there are one ring if no inner rings are provided). So check:\n\nFor first element, the coordinates seems: we have one ring, with 17 coordinate points (starting at point 146.75748456, -19.32504827, ending same) or 17 coordinate points. But let's count: We see coordinates separated by comma. Actually, the coordinates \"list-of-coordinates\" is: [146.75748456, -19.32504827], then next is [146.75762926, -19.32490217], then [146.75763266, -19.32489997], then [146.75792116, -19.32505817], then [146.75792206, -19.32506267], then [146.75770916, -19.32517567], then [146.75789926, -19.32527617], then [146.75789526, -19.32527727], then [146.75792586, -19.32506537], then [146.75769066, -19.32516777], then [146.75768656, -19.32517007], then [146.75763436, -19.32514217], then [146.75763306, -19.32513787], then [146.75752546, -19.32507767], then [146.75752536, -19.32507367], then [146.75752256, -19.32507087], then [146.75748456, -19.32504827].\n\nThus total points = 17? But if it's a closed polygon, the first equals last coordinate? Yes, it closes. However, typically in well-formed polygon, the first coordinate is repeated as last coordinate. So here it is repeated and works as the outer ring. It is in counter-clockwise direction to have positive area. But then we need to check the ring orientation etc. Usually outer ring should be with positive area (counterclockwise order) and holes should be clockwise order. But these are polygons in a MultiPolygon so they each must always have one outer ring at minimum. So one ring is outer polygon, possibly hole polygon may have inner rings. But here in the first element, there is probably just one ring.\n\nI also see that the second element is:\n\n[[[146.75760326, -19.32505787], [146.75760346, -19.32505827], [146.75760376, -19.32505877], [146.75760406, -19.32505907], [146.75765266, -19.32497307], [146.75765186, -19.32497277], [146.75765106, -19.32497267], [146.75765026, -19.32497257], [146.75764946, -19.32497267], [146.75764866, -19.32497297], [146.75764796, -19.32497327], [146.75764726, -19.32497377], [146.75764676, -19.32497427], [146.75764626, -19.32497497], [146.75760336, -19.32505657], [146.75760326, -19.325056â€¦ hang on let me compare: Actually everything seems similar. Let's break: The second element's coordinate points are negative coordinates to note. They are shape is almost exactly identical to the first ring? Let's check differences:\n\n[146.75760326, -19.32505787] is second polygon outer ring?\nBut then, next: [146.75760346, -19.32505827], then: [146.75760376, -19.32505877], then: [146.75760406, -19.32505907]. And then there's: [146.75765266, -19.32497307], then reversed coordinates: [146.75765186, -19.32497277], then [146.75765106, -19.32497267], then [146.75765026, -19.32497257], then [146.75764946, -19.32497267] (a repeat of what? not exactly duplicate, but similar numbers again), then [146.75764866, -19.32497297], then [146.75764796, -19.32497327], then [146.75764726, -19.32497377], then [146.75764676, -19.32497427], then [146.75764626, -19.32497497], and then returns to [146.75760336, -19.32505657]? Wait check: Actually after [146.75764626, -19.32497497] we have [146.75760326, -19.32505657] then [146.75760326, -19.32505607] likely and then [146.75760326, -19.32505707] then we see [146.75760326, -19.325057... Wait, let's re-read the provided coordinates exactly as text:\n\nThe second element is: \"[[[146.75760326, -19.32505787], [146.75760346, -19.32505827], [146.75760376, -19.32505877], [146.75760406, -19.32505907], [146.75765266, -19.32497307], [146.75765186, -19.32497277], [146.75765106, -19.32497267], [146.75765026, -19.32497257], [146.75764946, -19.32497267], [146.75764866, -19.32497297], [146.75764796, -19.32497327], [146.75764726, -19.32497377], [146.75764676, -19.32497427], [146.75764626, -19.32497497], [146.75760336, -19.32505657], [146.75760326, -19.32505607], [146.75760326, -19.32505707], [146.75760326, -19.32505787]]]\" reading that carefully.\n\nI notice potential issue: The second polygon ring has many points that are extremely similar between [146.75760326, -19.32505787] and others. Possibly it's almost a degenerate polygon? But also it seems that the first polygon is significantly different from the second polygon's coordinates. Or maybe they are similar polygons? Let's check: The first polygon coordinates have \"146.75748456\" for first coordinate, second polygon has \"146.75760326\" which is different. They both approximate to area, but they share similar pattern: something like shape boundaries that are extremely similar. Perhaps the second polygon is supposed to represent a hole? But if it's a hole then it's inside the first polygon, but the coordinates are clearly all outside or within the first? Let's check approximate differences:\n\nFor point 1: Outer: [146.75748456, -19.32504827]. Second: [146.75760326, -19.32505787]. The difference is about 0.0001 in east coordinates, and difference in south coordinates 0.0000096, so similar difference.\n\nThis could represent an extremely small polygon or even a \"spike\" shape? Not sure.\n\nThird element is: \"[[[146.75783426, -19.32517997], [146.75784526, -19.32518567], [146.75784646, -19.32518607], [146.75784776, -19.32518627], [146.75784906, -19.32518637], [146.75785036, -19.32518627], [146.75785166, -19.32518597], [146.75785286, -19.32518557], [146.75785406, -19.32518497], [146.75785506, -19.32518417], [146.75785606, -19.32518337], [146.75785686, -19.32518237], [146.75785746, -19.32518127], [146.75785796, -19.32518017], [146.75785826, -19.32517887], [146.75786566, -19.32508487], [146.75783426, -19.32517997]]]\"\n\nLet's count coordinates in third polygon ring. They are 15 coordinates:\n- It starts with [146.75783426, -19.32517997] then a series that appears to be a nearly perfect circle segment or arc shape, then [146.75786566, -19.32508487] then back to the starting point [146.75783426, -19.32517997]. It might be a \"blob\", but with extremely specific shape indices. (It might be a different field or shape.)\n\nWhat topology issues could be: likely self-intersections. Let me check possibility: In MultiPolygon, each polygon must not intersect its own boundary and must not intersect boundaries of other polygons (if these polygons share boundaries). However, in a MultiPolygon, they are separate polygons. But in a typical dataset, if you have multiple polygons, they might share boundaries. The latter two might be holes in the first polygon? But then the coordinate ordering might be incorrect (Hmm, might be structural issues.)\n\nGiven instructions: \"Analyze this GeoJSON feature for topological issues. Pay special attention to self-intersections where the polygon boundary crosses over itself.\" So I should examine rings for crossing segments.\n\nObservations: The first ring: It is a simple coordinate list, first point equals the last point, so loop. Is there any obvious crossing? The polygon seems a bit twisted? I'd re-read coordinates for outer ring of first polygon:\n\nOrder of coordinates approximating piecewise polygon:\n\nA (146.75748456, -19.32504827)\nB (146.75762926, -19.32490217): move from A to B, slight difference ~0.0001446 west (?), Actually I'll check differences: \n-- from A to B:\ndx = 146.75762926 - 146.75748456 = 0.00014470 east\ndy = -19.32490217 - (-19.32504827) = 0.00014610 north (so going north, and east).\nThen B to C: \nB: (146.75762926, -19.32490217)\nC: (146.75763266, -19.32489997):\ndx ~ 0.0000034 east, dy ~ 0.00220 (Slight north-north? Actually check: difference: -19.32490217 and -19.32489997, which is +0.00220? Actually no: because -19.32490217 vs -19.32489997 means - -19.32490217 = 19.32490217, -19.32489997 = about 19.32489997. Actually it's tiny difference, maybe this is simply a rounding error?)\nThen C to D:\nC: (146.75763266, -19.32489997)\nD: (146.75792116, -19.32505817): dx = 0.0002885 east, dy = -0.00015820 roughly? Because -19.32505817 - (-19.32489997) = -0.0001582? Actually, wait: No: -19.32505817 is south relative to -19.32489997, so dy = -0.00015820.\nThen D to E:\nD: (146.75792116, -19.32505817) to E: (146.75792206, -19.32506267) dx = 0.0000009, dy = -0.0000045\nThen E to F:\nF: (146.75770916, -19.32517567). So from E, dx = 146.75770916 - 146.75792206 = -0.0002129 east, dy = -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267) = -0.113? No,  -0.113? Actually let's compute differences: x diff: -0.0002129, y diff: -0.1130? Wait recalc: x: 146.75770916-146.75792206 = -0.0002129, y: -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267)= -0.1130? That seems off, I'll recalc carefully:\n\nBut wait, I re-check: D has x=146.75792116, y=-19.32505817; E has x=146.75792206, y=-19.32506267. \nDifference D->E: dx ~ 0.0000009, dy ~ -0.0045. Then E -> F : dx= 146.75770916-146.75792206 = -0.0002129, dy= -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267) = -0.1130? Wait, the difference y is: Actually use more precision: E_y = -19.32506267, F_y = -19.32517567 so difference = -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267)= -0.113? No that would be using seconds decimals: Let me compute difference: -19.32517567 + 19.32506267 = -0.113. That seems too large given the others are ~0.0001. But percentages here, maybe not, could be kilometers? Actually wait: original coordinates: 146... degrees, they are lat-long coordinates. There lat differences of 1e-4 typical variation are realistic differences. Here differences in tens of millionths? Wait I see: The coordinates are in degrees: 146.757... and -19.325... so differences ~ 0.0001, 0.00001 are common. But here from -19.32506267 to -19.32517567 is a difference of 0.113? Wait, recalc: 19.32517567 - 19.32506267 = 0.113. That is 0.113 degrees. That is quite large compared to differences of 0.0001 degrees. Possibly a typo in my arithmetic. Let's compute actual: -19.32506267 to -19.32517567 means the difference equals: -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267)= -19.32517567 + 19.32506267 = -0.113. Actually if we round: yes. But earlier differences in y were around 0.000146, 0.000002, 0.000158 etc. So suddenly now I'm seeing -0.113 which is nearly 2.5 times bigger if the period is similar. Is that intentional geometry? It might be a big difference if the polygon spans a larger area? The first polygon might be a parking lot maybe with possibly distance error in coordinate precision, but then small differences in second polygon are far smaller. Let's check second polygon points:\n\nSegment differences from first to second: Outer ring for second polygon:\npoint1: [146.75760326, -19.32505787] \npoint2: [146.75760346, -19.32505827]. \nDifferences: dx = 0.0000002, dy = 0.0000004 approximate rounding differences.\nThen point 2 to 3: dx 0.0000002, dy=0.0000005? Then suddenly jump: [146.75760376, -19.32505877] to then next one: [146.75760406, -19.32505907]. So these 4 points are extremely close coordinates. Then point 5: [146.75765266, -19.32497307].\nDifference from previous: x difference = 146.75765266 - 146.75760406 = 0.0000486 east roughly; y difference: -19.32497307 - (-19.32505907)= 0.0860 approximately. That might be substantial: move 0.086 degrees latitude? 0.086 degrees latitude corresponds to about 10 km difference because 1 degree lat is ~111 km. That is huge though? Wait check: 0.086 * 111 = 9.546 km. So suddenly the geometry, second polygon, moves from cluster of points that are extremely condensed to a far away coordinate which is also possibly mis-typed? Let me re-read the second polygon:\nCoordinates after the initial cluster of 4 nearly identical points: what is the jump? They are:\nPoints 1-4 in second polygon: They are nearly identical: p1: (146.75760326, -19.32505787); p2:(146.75760346, -19.32505827); p3: (146.75760376, -19.32505877); p4: (146.75760406, -19.32505907).\nThen point 5: (146.75765266, -19.32497307)\n\nNow 146.75765266 vs 146.75760406 is difference 0.0000486 east, but -19.32497307 vs -19.32505907: difference equals -19.32497307 - (-19.32505907)= 0.086 degrees. Wait what is the lat? Actually, -19.32497307 is greater than -19.32505907. A nearby coordinate difference? Let me recompute: -19.32497307 - (-19.32505907)= 0.086 I need to fix sign. Wait I'll do that:\n-19.32497307 + 19.32505907 = 0.08586 approx. Yes, it's definitely not a minute difference unless we assume degrees are in degrees and differences in lat: 0.08586 deg * 111 km = 9.53 km. However, note that for longitude, the multiplication factor is cos(latitude) ~ cos(-19Â°) approx 0.945, so in km east difference 0.0000486 * 111 * 0.945 = around 5.4 km? So the jump is huge relative to the cluster? That might be intended? Possibly there's a huge error.\n\nWait, is the cluster intentionally disjoint? They might not intersect. Let's check the second polygon's remaining points: It continues with points: after p5, then p6: (146.75765186, -19.32497277), p7: (146.75765106, -19.32497267), etc. So it seems there is a cluster of coordinates around (146.7576036, -19.325058) and then a jump to (146.75765266, -19.32497307) then back to cluster all nearly (146.75765, -19.32497). So the ring might have a very \"dented\" shape: With a spike going and then almost returning to the cluster. It might cause a self-intersection. Because the polygon is defined by a closed ring, if one arc crosses another? But wait, the ring itself: They are not consistently ordered if the ring is supposed to be oriented in one direction. They might produce an inconsistent ordering. \n\nObserving: Coordinates in a ring should follow in a consistent order (non-self-intersecting polygon). They should not have crossing edges. However, if a polygon has two distinct portions that are very close to each other, it might inadvertently create a self-intersection if the paths cross each other.\n\nNow consider third polygon: Outer ring for third polygon:\nCoordinates: Start at [146.75783426, -19.32517997].\nThen a series of coordinates: [146.75784526, -19.32518567], then [146.75784646, -19.32518607], then [146.75784776, -19.32518627], then [146.75784906, -19.32518637], then [146.75785036, -19.32518627], then [146.75785166, -19.32518597], then [146.75785286, -19.32518557], then [146.75785406, -19.32518497], then [146.75785506, -19.32518417], then [146.75785606, -19.32518337], then [146.75785686, -19.32518237], then [146.75785746, -19.32518127], then [146.75785796, -19.32518017], then [146.75785826, -19.32517887], then jump: [146.75786566, -19.32508487] then back to [146.75783426, -19.32517997].\n\nThis third polygon: There is a cluster of points near (146.7578, -19.32518...) and then a jump near the 15th coordinate [146.75786566, -19.32508487]. That difference: from near first events: 146.75785 to 146.75786566, and y: -19.32518 to -19.32508487, difference roughly 0.000049 and 0.095? Actually, check: -19.32508487 - (-19.32517997)= 0.0951 approx. So that's similar to the second polygon spike, but with different numbers. This ring might be nearly circular or rectangular? Actually, it appears the ring might have taken a \"curve\" around and then a spike that connects back to the cluster. I suspect there might be self-intersections in both second and third polygons, where there is a \"spike\" that nearly touches the original cluster but does not exactly, but I need to check order and if the ring goes through itself.\n\nMore systematically: We are asked to \"analyze this GeoJSON feature for topological issues. Pay special attention to self-intersections where the polygon boundary crosses over itself.\" So we need to examine if any polygon ring is self-crossing.\n\nI need to consider possible issues regarding ring orientation: All outer rings must be in counterclockwise (CCW) order so that the polygon has positive area. Holes need to be clockwise. If I can detect coordinate precision issues with nearly identical coordinates. Observing the coordinates: Some coordinates seem extremely similar, differences around 0.00004 in x, differences around 0.00001 in y. Perhaps these repeated similar numbers indicate that the polygon vertices are repeated with minor differences which might be rounding errors.\n\nFor instance, in first polygon: P1: (146.75748456, -19.32504827) and final coordinate: (146.75748456, -19.32504827) are identical; that's good. However, there are some self-intersection issues? In first polygon, is it self-intersecting? Possibly if it looks like a star shape. But the coordinates don't obviously indicate any crossing; however, one of the segments might cross an earlier segment if the ring is not simple.\n\nLet's try to manually verify if the first polygon might have crossing segments. Coordinates for first polygon:\n\nPoint 1: A = (146.75748456, -19.32504827)\nPoint 2: B = (146.75762926, -19.32490217)\nPoint 3: C = (146.75763266, -19.32489997)\nPoint 4: D = (146.75792116, -19.32505817)\nPoint 5: E = (146.75792206, -19.32506267)\nPoint 6: F = (146.75770916, -19.32517567)\nPoint 7: G = (146.75789926, -19.32527617)\nPoint 8: H = (146.75789526, -19.32527727)\nPoint 9: I = (146.75792586, -19.32506537)\nPoint 10: J = (146.75769066, -19.32516777)\nPoint 11: K = (146.75768656, -19.32517007)\nPoint 12: L = (146.75763436, -19.32514217)\nPoint 13: M = (146.75763306, -19.32513787)\nPoint 14: N = (146.75752546, -19.32507767)\nPoint 15: O = (146.75752536, -19.32507367)\nPoint 16: P = (146.75752256, -19.32507087)\nThen back to A equals (146.75748456, -19.32504827).\n\nWe can check potential \"bow-tie\" structure if any edge crosses previously drawn segments. Hard to see visually.\n\nGiven the list of coordinates for first polygon, I suspect the polygon might be self-intersecting. Let's see: The ring starts at A and goes to B, then to C just a slight move, then jumps to D far east. Then edge from D to E is very short (they are extremely close except y changes by 0.004 maybe? Actually, from D: (146.75792116, -19.32505817) to E: (146.75792206, -19.32506267), dy = -0.0045, but that doesn't match: -19.32506267 - (-19.32505817)= -0.0045 exactly)\nThen from E to F: from (146.75792206, -19.32506267) to (146.75770916, -19.32517567), that is a jump to the left by 0.000213 and downward by 0.1130. Then from F to G: from (146.75770916, -19.32517567) to (146.75789926, -19.32527617), dx= 0.0001901, dy= -0.1005? Actually, check: 146.75789926-146.75770916= 0.000190, and y: -19.32527617 - (-19.32517567)= -0.1005. That's very different. Then from G to H: very tiny differences: from (146.75789926, -19.32527617) to (146.75789526, -19.32527727) ~ (-0.004, -0.0011)? Wait, recalc: 146.75789926-146.75789526 = 0.004, but dy: -19.32527727 - (-19.32527617)= -0.001. Actually recalc: Actually 146.75789926-146.75789526 = 0.004? But that seems too big: 0.004 and then later segment from D to E is 0.0000009, so consistency is not maintained.\n\nI must recalc differences precisely:\n\nFor first polygon:\nA = (146.75748456, -19.32504827).\nB = (146.75762926, -19.32490217).\ndx = 146.75762926 - 146.75748456 = 0.00014470, dy = -19.32490217 - (-19.32504827)= 0.00014610, so roughly nearly equal differences (drift by 0.0001447 east, ~0.0001461 north).\n\nB -> C:\nB = (146.75762926, -19.32490217), C = (146.75763266, -19.32489997),\ndx=0.0000034, dy= -19.32489997 - (-19.32490217) = 0.0022? Wait: -19.32489997 - (-19.32490217)= 0.00220, which is weird relative to differences above, but maybe is due to difference? Actually 19.32490217 - 19.32489997 = 0.00220, but if lat differences were in degrees then 0.00220 degrees is about 244 km. That is huge. Something is inconsistent: The previous segment was 0.0001447 east and 0.0001461 north, differences of order 1e-4. Now here difference becomes 0.00220? That seems off. Could it be a mistake in text? It's possible I'm misinterpreting the decimal formatting. Actually, what's difference: \n-19.32490217 and -19.32489997: difference in y = (-19.32489997) - (-19.32490217)= 0.0000022 (not 0.00220). Let me recalc manually because of possible issues: The code says [-19.32490217, -19.32489997]. The difference = -19.32489997 + 19.32490217 = 0.00000220. Yes, it's 2.2e-6, sorry. My earlier calculation was wrong factor 1000 because of mis-reading the decimal point.\nLet me re-read coordinates with proper parsing:\nFor A: 146.75748456, -19.32504827\nB: 146.75762926, -19.32490217\nDifference B - A:\ndx = 0.00014470, dy = (-19.32490217) - (-19.32504827) = 0.00014610.\nC: 146.75763266, -19.32489997.\nDifference from B:\ndx = 146.75763266 - 146.75762926 = 0.00000340, dy = (-19.32489997) - (-19.32490217) = 0.00000220.\nD: 146.75792116, -19.32505817.\nDifference from C:\ndx = 146.75792116 - 146.75763266 = 0.00028850, dy = (-19.32505817) - (-19.32489997) = -0.00015820. \nE: 146.75792206, -19.32506267.\nDifference from D:\ndx = 146.75792206 - 146.75792116 = 0.00000090, dy = (-19.32506267) - (-19.32505817) = -0.00000450.\nF: 146.75770916, -19.32517567.\nDifference from E:\ndx = 146.75770916 - 146.75792206 = -0.0002129, dy = (-19.32517567) - (-19.32506267)= -0.11300? That doesn't match though: (-19.32517567 - (-19.32506267)) = -0.11300 indeed. But look, 0.11300 is not of the same order as 0.000*? It is many orders of magnitude difference. Let's re-read F carefully: It's listed as 146.75770916, -19.32517567. And E's y coordinate was -19.32506267, so difference in y = -19.32517567 + 19.32506267 = -0.113. That is huge relative to others. Let me check again: the y coordinate of E is -19.32506267. The y coordinate of F seems like a jump from -19.32506267 to -19.32517567. But if we look at the decimal values, they appear as:\n-19.32506267 and -19.32517567, the difference: 0.112? Possibly it's not 0.112 but 0.112 as in hundredths? Wait, but previous differences were differences around 0.0001 (which is 0.0001). 0.113 is 0.113. That is nearly a factor of 1000 difference. That is huge. So likely it's F: 146.75770916, -19.32517567. But maybe I need to check if these differences are correct: There's a jump from E which was (146.75792206, -19.32506267) to F which is (146.75770916, -19.32517567). dx = 146.75770916 - 146.75792206 = -0.0002129, which is small relative to the previous differences from A to B which were 0.0001447; so that dx difference is plausible. But y difference: (-19.32517567) - (-19.32506267)= -0.113, that would be not plausible if the typical differences are around 0.0001, so maybe the coordinates in F have a missing decimal place, or maybe the intended values are different? Possibly they intended to have a smaller difference? Perhaps there is a formatting issue in the given GeoJSON: It could be that coordinates such as 146.75770916, -19.32517567 might be the correct number. But if typical polygon vertices differences are in the order of 10^-5 to 10^-4, a jump of 0.113 degrees is an order of magnitude difference. Perhaps we double-check the provided first polygon: It starts at around 146.75748456 and -19.32504827, then goes to near 146.757629, -19.324902. The latitudes are around -19.325, then suddenly it goes to -19.32517567. That is a difference of ~ -19.32517567 vs -19.32504827. The difference is 0.0001274. That is more like a 0.000127 difference. But then from B to F, the difference in y is unexpectedly computed as -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267) is -0.113? I'm confused because if I check coordinates relative to start: A_y = -19.32504827, then B_y = -19.32490217, so difference is 0.0001461? Then A to measures: if polygon vertices are all mean coordinates around -19.325, then they should be near -19.325, differences on the order of 0.0001, not 0.113. 0.113 is huge.\n\nLet me re-read the coordinates provided as exactly printed:\n\nThe first polygon coordinate array: \n    [[146.75748456, -19.32504827],\n     [146.75762926, -19.32490217],\n     [146.75763266, -19.32489997],\n     [146.75792116, -19.32505817],\n     [146.75792206, -19.32506267],\n     [146.75770916, -19.32517567],\n     [146.75789926, -19.32527617],\n     [146.75789526, -19.32527727],\n     [146.75792586, -19.32506537],\n     [146.75769066, -19.32516777],\n     [146.75768656, -19.32517007],\n     [146.75763436, -19.32514217],\n     [146.75763306, -19.32513787],\n     [146.75752546, -19.32507767],\n     [146.75752536, -19.32507367],\n     [146.75752256, -19.32507087],\n     [146.75748456, -19.32504827]]\n\nI want to check any dissonance: The coordinates of point F: 146.75770916, -19.32517567.\nThe difference between F and previous point E: (146.75770916 vs 146.75792206 = difference -0.0002129) and y: (-19.32517567 vs -19.32506267 = difference is -0.113, but wait  -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267) equals -0.1130? Because -19.32517567 + 19.32506267 gives -0.113 which is 0.113 but with sign. 0.113 is off by factor 1000 relative to others. Letâ€™s check another segment: B to E? For instance, from first coordinate A: -19.32504827, then B: -19.32490217, difference = 0.0001461, so they are consistent. So F should be around 0.0001 difference from E_y. But -19.32506267 to -19.32517567 would be 0.000112? Let's recalc exactly: -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267) = -19.32517567 + 19.32506267 = -0.000113. Actually I might have misinterpreted the subtraction: Let y_E = -19.32506267. Subtract y_F = -19.32517567. Difference = -19.32517567 - (-19.32506267)= -19.32517567 + 19.32506267= -0.000113. Yes, because 19.32517567 - 19.32506267 = 0.000113 (and negative sign applies). So that's actually 0.000113 difference, not 0.113. I was mistaken because I might have misread the minus sign. Actually correct: 19.32517567 - 19.32506267 = 0.000113, so so far calculations: A_y = -19.32504827, B_y = -19.32490217, difference = 0.0001461, C_y = -19.32489997, difference from B is 0.0000022, D_y = -19.32505817, difference from C is 0.0001582 but it should be 19.32489997 - 19.32505817 = 0.0001582 (0.1582 is not plausible: a difference of 0.0001582 degrees? That would be about 700 meters maybe? Actually 0.000158 degrees *111 km = 17.5 km, that's too large compared to 0.0001447 east difference multiplied by cos ~? Hmm.)\nLet's check: 0.0001447 degrees is about 1.6 km east in New Caledonia maybe. But then 0.000113 degrees is about 12.5 km? Not sure.\n\nLetâ€™s step back and forget the conversion to distances. All differences are relative differences (which are in degrees). The fact the differences vary by orders of magnitude might be due to a misreading: Perhaps all differences are of order 1e-4. \nLet's focus on potential self-intersections and duplicates rather than arc lengths.\n\nI can check if any vertex is repeated multiple times. In the first polygon, notice that the first and the last coordinate is exactly the same: (146.75748456, -19.32504827). Also, there are coordinates that look nearly identical, like (146.75752546, -19.32507767) and then immediately after (146.75752536, -19.32507367) and then (146.75752256, -19.32507087). They are very close; indeed they might be almost collinear. The slight differences might be due to rounding errors, but it's questionable if the small differences would indicate a vertex that should be merged.\n\nIn the second polygon, I see in the cluster 1-4 are extremely similar. They differ only in small increments: (146.75760326, -19.32505787) then others. That might be due to compression or to faking differences. They might be repeated coordinates with rounding errors that should have been the same coordinate. It might be a precision problem.\n\nAlso, the jump between coordinates in second polygon (after the cluster, jump to the next clause) seems drastic: From cluster round about (146.75760406, -19.32505907) to next (146.75765266, -19.32497307) - look at differences: dx = 0.0000486, dy difference: -19.32497307 - (-19.32505907) = 0.086? Check: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307= 0.086 exactly? Actually, it's 0.086, not 8.6e-4. That is 0.086 degrees is 9.5 km. Then subsequent coordinates are clustered around 146.75765, -19.32497. Then at the end of ring, the coordinates come back to cluster of points and then nearly identical to the beginning. That might represent a spike or indentation that may cross itself to form a self-intersection.\n\nFor example, in the second polygon: It might be constructed by first clustering around one point, then making a \"loopy\" description that goes out and then returns, and in doing so, one of the edges might cross an edge in the cluster region. We can suspect that the small cluster and then the jump back could cause complexity. But I should try to visualize: The cluster of about 4 points, then a jump to something far away (but in the local coordinate system, the difference between these points might be in the order of 0.086 degrees in latitude, which is extremely large difference relative to the cluster differences which are in the order of 2e-6 and 3e-4 degrees? Actually, wait, let's re-calc relative: \nFor cluster points, differences are on the order of 0.0001 maybe. Actually, let's compute differences in second polygon cluster:\nPoint1: (146.75760326, -19.32505787)\nPoint2: (146.75760346, -19.32505827) => dx is 0.00000020, dy is 0.00000040. \nSo difference order = 1e-7 to 1e-7 degrees? \nWait, I'm now confused: Differences: 0.0001 vs 0.000000. Actually, 146.75760326 vs 146.75760346 is a difference of 0.00000020, and the y difference similarly is extremely small. But then the next few points: (146.75760376, -19.32505877), then (146.75760406, -19.32505907) have differences of 0.0000002 - indeed differences on the order of 2e-7. So the cluster are identical to many decimals, and then at point 5: (146.75765266, -19.32497307) is a significant jump. Let me calculate differences precisely: \nCluster last point: p4: (146.75760406, -19.32505907), then p5: (146.75765266, -19.32497307). \ndx = 146.75765266 - 146.75760406 = 0.00004860.\ndy difference: (-19.32497307) - (-19.32505907)= 0.086 = (19.32505907 - 19.32497307)= 0.086 exactly. But wait, 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 is 0.086? Actually, letâ€™s do: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = 0.086? But 0.05907 - 0.97307, no that doesn't work. Actually, compute: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = 0.000086? Possibly my misinterpretation: Actually, let me do subtract: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = 0.000086? Let's do: 19.32505907 minus 19.32497307 equals 0.000086. Because 0.05907 - 0.97307 = 0. - Wait, I'm making a mistake: x= -19.32505907, y= -19.32497307. The difference = -19.32497307 - (-19.32505907)= 0.0860... how do we compute? \nTake absolute difference: | -19.32497307 - (-19.32505907) |= | 19.32497307 - 19.32505907 | = 0.085, but check digit by digit: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307, subtract: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = 0.000086, because the difference from 19.32505907 to 19.32500007 is 0.059? Wait, let me do it carefully: Let a = 19.32505907, b = 19.32497307. Then a - b = 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = 0.00008600. Because if we subtract 19.32500007, that would be 0.059... Not sure. Let's do digit by digit: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = \nIt might be easier: 19.325059 - 19.324973 equals 0.000086. Because if we round to 6 decimal digits, 19.325059 - 19.324973= 0.000086. Yes, because 19.325059 vs 19.324973 difference: subtract: 19.32505907 - 19.32497307 = 0.000086. So dx difference in second polygon relative jump: 0.0000486 and dy difference: 0.000086. These differences are still on the order of 1e-4, consistent with typical coordinates. So then the second polygon ring is: cluster, then jump, then cluster, then back to cluster. The polygon might be nearly a circle or ellipse, but the order of vertices might be causing self-intersections if the spike intersects the existing edges. \nWait, check the sequence: In a well-formed polygon, if there is an indentation that creates a spike, there might be a crossing if the spike overshoots the outer boundary. But since all coordinates are ordered in a consistent order, they might not have a crossing if the vertex ordering is monotonic (or maybe they are clockwise vs counterclockwise).\nI need to check orientation. For outer rings, the orientation should be counterclockwise for non-self-intersecting polygons. I can compute approximate signed area for each ring quickly. The area formula for polygon in geojson is given by summing cross products. Without doing full computation by hand, I can at least check if the order is likely clockwise or anticlockwise by summing up the naive differences. \nFor the first polygon: The differences seem small. Likely the area is computed with a sum of (x_i*y_i1 - x_(i+1)*y_i). The first polygon: With approximate coordinates, it might be set up to have positive area if that order is maintained.\nFor the second polygon: I'll check orientation for second polygon by computing approximate area summing segments. Use formula: A = sum over vertices: 0.5 * (x_i*y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}*y_i). I'd need to compute for second polygon manually if not too many vertices? But it has 15 vertices. I'd rather check the sign of the differences: If the polygon is not self-intersecting, the area sum sign should be consistent.\n\nI wonder if the arcs in the second and third polygons are simply degenerate or \"spikes\". The many points with extremely small differences may indicate they are anti-clockwise. \nI can check second polygon first few segments: p1 = (146.75760326, -19.32505787), p2 = (146.75760346, -19.32505827). Cross product = x1 y2 - x2 y1. \n= 146.75760326 * (-19.32505827) - 146.75760346 * (-19.32505787). That difference will be extremely small, but sign? Actually, let me compute approximate difference: 146.75760326*(-19.32505827) ~ -2834.65 (approx, but I can get sign) and for second term 146.75760346*(-19.32505787) ~ -2834.65 slightly different, but probably the difference is negative? Hard, but then later segments may flip sign.\n\nI suspect potential self-intersection in the second polygon ring due to the 'jump'. But I must try to check if the polygon edges intersect. The second polygon: There are vertices: p1, p2, p3, p4 belong to one cluster, then p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, etc. They likely form a shape with a pronounced spike. Possibly a typical problematic scenario in many polygon datasets is a ring that \"touches\" itself, i.e. a polygon showing a crossing where an indentation nearly meets the outer loop.\n\nI need to check if coordinates are repeated with only minimal differences that should have been identical. For example, in the second polygon, p1 and p? I see p1 is (146.75760326, -19.32505787) and p? Then near the end, there are coordinates (146.75760326, -19.32505607) and then (146.75760326, -19.32505707) and then (146.75760326, -19.32505787). There is a slight difference: p1: y = -19.32505787, then later p? Actually, check: \nSecond polygon coordinates (expanding with indices):\np1: (146.75760326, -19.32505787)\np2: (146.75760346, -19.32505827)\np3: (146.75760376, -19.32505877)\np4: (146.75760406, -19.32505907)\np5: (146.75765266, -19.32497307)\np6: (146.75765186, -19.32497277)\np7: (146.75765106, -19.32497267)\np8: (146.75765026, -19.32497257)\np9: (146.75764946, -19.32497267)\np10: (146.75764866, -19.32497297)\np11: (146.75764796, -19.32497327)\np12: (146.75764726, -19.32497377)\np13: (146.75764676, -19.32497427)\np14: (146.75764626, -19.32497497)\np15: (146.75760336, -19.32505657)? Wait, re-read: After p14, next coordinate: [146.75760336, -19.32505657]. So p15 actually: (146.75760336, -19.32505657).\np16: (146.75760326, -19.32505607)\np17: (146.75760326, -19.32505707)\np18: (146.75760326, -19.32505787)\n\nWe see that coordinate (146.75760326, -19.32505787) is repeated as p1 and p18, which is expected for a ring closure. But there are also coordinates with almost identical values, but slight differences like p15 vs p18: p15: (146.75760336, -19.32505657) is slightly different from p18: (146.75760326, -19.32505787) and p16: (146.75760326, -19.32505607). The differences are extremely small as well, maybe just rounding noise. The small differences might cause a self-intersection if precision is insufficient.\n\nI suspect the most probable issues:\n1. The second and third coordinates seem to contain nearly identical values (multiple repeated points with slight differences), which might indicate potential rounding errors or duplicate vertices which can lead to self-intersections or non-well-formed polygon rings (coinciding segments).\n2. There might be actual self-intersections, particularly because the clusters with near-identical coordinates might cause adjacent edges to be almost collinear, and slight differences might cause overlaps.\n3. Another common issue in many GeoJSON outputs is precision/coordinate problems: coordinates are given with high precision (14 digits) but then many values are very similar, which might indicate either intentional smoothing or errors in snapping or coordinate simplification.\n\nLetâ€™s compare the three rings:\n\nRing A: I've listed with vertices: p1 to p17, p18 identical to p1. This might form a polygon, but may be crossing if the shape is concave. Given the coordinates, letâ€™s examine potential intersections in ring A. The vertices go:\n- p1 to p2: roughly a small segment.\n- p2 to p3: similarly tiny segment. So these two edges almost coincide.\n- p3 to p4: Again very tiny.\n- p4: Then at the fifth vertex, jump: p4 to p5: p4 is (146.75792116, -19.32505817) and p5 is (146.75770916, -19.32517567). That is a change: dx ~ 146.75770916 - 146.75792116 â‰ˆ -0.000212, and dy: -19.32517567 - (-19.32505817) = -0.0001175 maybe? Let me recalc exactly: 146.75792116 - 146.75770916 = 0.000212, y difference = -19.32517567 + 19.32505817 = -0.000117. So that's a segment with a slope approximately = (difference in x = -0.000212, difference in y = -0.0001175). Slope = 0.0001175/0.000212 ~ 0.55 maybe.\n- Then p5 to p6: p5 = (146.75770916, -19.32517567) to p6 = (146.75765186, -19.32497277). dx = -0.0000573, dy = -19.32497277 - (-19.32517567)= 0.2029? Actually, recalc: -19.32497277 - (-19.32517567)= 0.2029? Because 19.32517567 - 19.32497277= 0.2029? Yes, so jump in y is 0.2029, which is significantly larger than before. That suggests there might be an error; however, check sign: Actually, let me re-calc carefully p5: (146.75770916, -19.32517567), p6: (146.75765186, -19.32497277). So difference: dx = 146.75770916 - 146.75765186 = 0.0000573 (positive? actually 146.75770916 > 146.75765186 so dx= 0.0000573), and dy = -19.32497277 - (-19.32517567) = 0.2029, interestingly, but wait ending dt: That jump seems huge relative to the cluster differences. In the previous segments differences in x ~ 0.00014 and differences in y ~ 0.00014, and at p4 to p5, differences in x was 0.000212, in y was ~0.0001175. But here, the jump from p5 to p6: dx=146.75770916 - 146.75765186 = 0.0000573, dy= (-19.32497277) - (-19.32517567) = 0.2029. Actually, wait, -19.32497277 is greater than -19.32517567 by 0.2029? Because 19.32517567 - 19.32497277= 0.2029. That means the polygon jumps nearly 0.2 degrees of latitude which is huge (about 22 km)? That is inconsistent with typical small adjustments of 1e-4. It might be a mistake in transcription: Possibly the numbers are off: Likely p6 is supposed to be (146.75765186, -19.32517567) if the y coordinate didn't jump or maybe the p5 coordinate should have been (146.75770916, -19.32417567) maybe there's a mis-typing of one digit in the y coordinate. \nGiven that the subsequent vertices, p7, p8, etc, are between 146.757651 and 146.757649 something and -19.324972??? which is similar to p6, then p5 is similar to p6, they are losing the hundredth after the seconds one: Actually, look at p6: y: -19.32497277, p7: -19.32497267, p8: -19.32497257, p9: -19.32497267 (dup), p10: -19.32497297, p11: -19.32497327, p12: -19.32497377, p13: -19.32497427, p14: -19.32497497, then jump back to cluster: p15: (146.75760336, -19.32505657) which has y = -19.32505657 ~ which is nearly identical to p? Actually, p15: -19.32505657;\nThen p16: -19.32505607,\np17: -19.32505707,\nand finally p18 equal to p1: -19.32505787.\n\nObserving the pattern in p4 to p18 in the first polygon: The first segment from p1 through p4 are mostly increasing slightly, then p4 to p5 is a jump to a vertex that is nearly p5, then a jump from p5 to within a cluster with essentially duplicated points (p5 through p14) along with slight differences, then the ring closes in the cluster near the beginning. This pattern is clearly a typical pattern of a polygon with a precision issue: Many vertices have exact duplicates that are nearly identical (like p2, p3, p4, then p5 to p14). This is extremely suspicious, because it suggests that either the coordinates were quantized to a grid (like 0.000001 increments) or the data has many identical coordinates that might result in pop-up self intersections. Also, the polygon ring with many repeated or almost repeated values may actually produce zero-length segments, which is undesirable.\n\nFurthermore, the third polygon ring: It has points that are also closely spaced: It starts from 146.75783426,... then goes through a series of slightly increasing values until p? then jumps to 146.75786566, -19.32508487, then back to original. We see similar pattern: cluster of points with extremely small differences, then a jump, then another cluster. Which again could be self-intersecting if the jump line crosses the earlier part of the ring.\n\nI suspect that all three rings show similar structural pattern: They have almost identical (repeated) coordinates implying potential rounding artifacts. Also, there might be self-intersection points where the ring crosses itself if the \"spike\" from the jump overlaps with a portion of the cluster or if the ring folds back on itself.\n\nLet me check for self-intersection criteria: A self-intersecting polygon (a self-crossing polygon) is one where a boundary segment intersects another. That could be done by checking each combination of segments in the ring. Visually, given the numbers, the clusters are extremely small in magnitude relative to the jump segments, but if the ring is effectively almost a closed loop with a nearly zero-length re-entrant angle, it might cross itself at the point of the jump.\n\nMaybe I can check: In the first polygon, segment from p4 to p5: from (146.75792116, -19.32505817) to (146.75770916, -19.32517567). Then later segments like from p6 to p7: p6: (146.75765186, -19.32497277) to p7: (146.75765106, -19.32497267). They are very short. The entire path might be weaving and folding in a lot of repetitive vertices. With many duplicate points, it's likely that several segments almost coincide, and can cause overlapping boundaries.\n\nFor the second polygon, one potential self-intersection might be if the cluster near the start and near the end of the sequence cross each other. Also, check third polygon: It starts with coordinates (146.75783426, -19.32517997) and then goes to (146.75784526, -19.32518567)... these edges are extremely short, then after many almost identical edges, it jumps to (146.75786566, -19.32508487), then goes back to the cluster at (146.75783426, -19.32517997). The jump edge from (146.75786566, -19.32508487) to (146.75783426, -19.32517997) is long and likely crosses over the previously drawn edges around the cluster. This could definitely be a self-intersection.\n\nSo issues: \n- The polygon coordinates are recorded with extreme precision up to 14 decimal places, which might be more than required.\n- Some coordinates are nearly identical, implying possible duplicated vertices.\n- The jumps between a cluster of nearly identical coordinates and a vertex that is offset could indicate that the polygon is self-intersecting, particularly if the closing edge intersects the open side of the polygon.\n- The rings might not be oriented consistently (swapping the ring orientation order might result in holes being wrongly labeled as outer rings or vice versa).\n\nAdditionally, one potential problem: In a MultiPolygon, the outer polygon must contain a non-intersecting path, and holes must be contained and are non-self intersecting and should have even winding if incorrectly oriented. The given data does not include explicit holes (only one ring per polygon), so it's simpler.\n\nHowever, the provided JSON keys \"id\", \"fclass\": \"parking\". The id is \"21941\". The feature-level properties have fclass parking. The geometry is MultiPolygon. Here, each polygon (each element of coordinates array) is meant to be a separate polygon. But perhaps there's a mistake: parking lots typically are simple polygons, not multi polygons. But apparently there are three polygons. They might be intended to represent different surfaces or boundaries of a parking area? Hard to say.\n\nI need to give a structured answer outlining the points:\n- There are repeated vertices which may indicate duplicate or unnecessary coordinates (e.g., p2 and p3 in each cluster, which appear to be approximated but not equal yet, might not cause actual self-intersection but could lead to topology algorithms treating them as vertices).\n- The rings likely have segments with near-zero lengths (very similar coordinates) which might be problematic (degeneracy).\n- The order of coordinates is such that a \"spike\" in one of the rings might cause the boundary to cross itself. For instance, in the first polygon, after going through p4, there is an edge from p4 to p5 that re-enters the polygon and then p5 to p6, then the subsequent edges all come back to a nearly identical point, so the polygon might self-inter","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}]}
