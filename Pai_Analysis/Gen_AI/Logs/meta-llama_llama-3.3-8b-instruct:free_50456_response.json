Upon tracing the boundary coordinates, I found that certain segments cross over each other, indicating a self-intersection. This issue is a common problem in geometric data and can be visually represented as a bowtie or figure-8 shape. The other categories, including invalid geometries, ring orientation issues, and precision/coordinate problems, do not appear to be present in this feature.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1274,"completion_tokens":128,"total_tokens":1402}}
