FEATURE 21936:
FEATURE [21936]:  
Self-intersections: **Yes**  
Invalid geometries: **Yes**  
Ring orientation issues: **No**  
Precision/coordinate issues: **No**  

**Explanation:**  
1. **Self-intersections:** The first polygon exhibits suspiciously convoluted coordinate sequences (e.g., jumping between `[146.75841546, -19.32305177]` → `[146.75850356, -19.32328277]` → `[146.75849756, -19.32320667]`), suggesting a "bowtie" fold where ring edges cross themselves. The sixth polygon also has edges that appear to reverse direction sharply (e.g., `[146.75883006, -19.32373777]` → `[146.75882886, -19.32374007]` then back to the start point), potentially crossing an earlier segment.  
2. **Invalid geometries:** None of the polygons explicitly close their rings (the first and last coordinates of each ring are not identical). GeoJSON requires all LinearRings to explicitly close with the starting point.  
3. **Ring orientation:** Cannot confirm orientation errors because strict validation (e.g., direction checks) depends on closed rings, which are invalidated by the lack of closure.  
4. **Precision:** Coordinates are precise to 5 or 6 decimal places, which is within acceptable bounds for geographic data (approx. 1–11 cm precision, depending on latitude). No extreme values are present.  

**Recommendation:** Fix the unclosed rings and simplify complex paths to resolve self-intersections. Use a geometry validator like Shapely to confirm.

Self-intersections: Yes

Precision/coordinate issues: No

Self-intersections: The first polygon exhibits problematic self-intersections. When tracing the coordinates, the path from [149.17127825, -35.28396006] to [149.17118025, -35.28391066] overlaps with earlier segments, and the final segment [149.17107445, -35.28360016] to [149.17151355, -35.28442816] creates a figure-eight looping pattern. The second polygon's outer ring also shows irregular movement that likely results in self-intersections.

Invalid geometries: All rings are closed (first and last coordinates match), and there are no obvious duplicate vertices listed in the coordinate sequences, so no invalid geometries detected.

Ring orientation issues: The first polygon's **outer ring orientation is problematic**. While not definitively detected without a full area calculation, the sequence of coordinates doesn't maintain a clear counterclockwise direction. Similarly, the second polygon's outer ring's complex coordinate path suggests the overall orientation might not conform to expected CCW/outer ring requirements. The inner ring in the second polygon appears to be correctly oriented as a clockwise ring for a hole, as the first few coordinate pairs suggest a clockwise turn.

Precision/coordinate issues: Coordinates are within valid EPSG:4326 (longitude between ~149.17 to 149.174 and latitude ~-35.28 to -35.284) and use 5-7 decimal places (within reasonable precision for geodetic data). No extreme or suspect values present.

FEATURE 21941:
FEATURE 21941:  
Self-intersections: **YES**  
Invalid geometries: **YES**  
Ring orientation issues: **NO**  
Precision/coordinate issues: **NO**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Self-intersections & Invalid geometries:** The second polygon (coordinates array) exhibits a tight zig-zag loop where the boundary crosses itself. Coordinates like `[146.75765186, -19.32497277]` and `[146.75785746, -19.32518127]` create overlapping segments when connected in sequence, forming a self-intersecting ring. This invalidates the geometry according to OGC standards.  
- **Ring orientation:** All outer rings appear to follow a consistent orientation. The first polygon’s coordinates start and end at the same point, forming a closed loop, and the sequence suggests counterclockwise traversal (no clear reversal in direction).  
- **Precision/coordinate issues:** Coordinates are within standard GPS precision (7 decimal places) and have no inconsistent values (e.g., longitudes over 180 or invalid ranges).  

Self-intersections are a type of invalid geometry, so both categories are marked "YES" for this case.
